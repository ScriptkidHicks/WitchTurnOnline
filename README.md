# WitchTurnOnline
    *The Witch Turn app is a tool for tabletop players and their gms to manage initiative in games, provide the Gm a way to manage clocks, and the players a way to view some / all of those clocks. The dev(s) of this app found that there were a lot of tools online for managing tabletop simulators, or shared dice rolling, but none for visualizing shared clocks, or viewing initiative.*


## Rooms
  Using the websockets io tool, combined with react, this app has been set up to provide users with shared rooms, much in the style of the jackbox games. Eventually we would like to add the functionality which allows the user to save the contents of rooms out, so that they can quick load them again if they need to pause a session.
